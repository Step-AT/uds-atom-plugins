## ðŸ“Œ How to contribute?

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Fork and clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-user/uds-atom-sourcer-modbus-tcp.git
cd uds-atom-sourcer-modbus-tcp
```

Add the main repository as a remote to keep your fork up to date:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/step-at/uds-atom-plugin-modbus.git
git fetch upstream
```

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Create a branch for your modification
Always work on a new branch based on main :

```bash
git checkout -b feature-my-feature
```

Use a clear branch name, for example:
âœ… feature-add-tls-support (for a new feature)
âœ… fix-bug-timeout-fix (for a bug fix)

Make sure your code respects the project style.
Add tests if your change changes the plugin's behavior.
Check that everything works before submitting your contribution.
### ðŸ”¹ 4. Commit and push your changes
Format your commit messages clearly:

```bash
git commit -m "Added TLS support for Modbus connection"
```

Then, push your branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature-my-feature
```

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
On GitHub:

- Go to your fork and click on "New pull request".
